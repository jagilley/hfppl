1. The return of the House means new energy for the GOP’s Biden impeachment push, and Democrats are starting their pushback early. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) is out this morning with a 14-page rebuttal memo that seeks to paint the GOP campaign as a “complete and total bust” and an attempt at distracting from the “overwhelming evidence of [Trump’s] criminal and corrupt conduct during his term of office.”

2. The Senate is back this evening for a bed-check vote. With Minority Leader Mitch McConnell having successfully quieted (public) chatter about his health, expect senators to be quizzed anew about Sen. Tommy Tuberville’s (R-Ala.) Pentagon nominee blockade, especially with the Joint Chiefs chair, Gen. Mark Milley, just weeks away from retirement and the confirmation of his successor, Gen. C.Q. Brown, in limbo.
